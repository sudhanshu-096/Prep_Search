Every application is reviewed by a PrepSearch administrator. You must have a verifiable biography on your school site and a College/University work email address ending in .edu. At PrepSearch we take the security of the student-athlete information in our database very seriously. Anyone submitting registration for a fake account or under an assumed identity will be subject to state and/or federal prosecution.
PrepSearch database and app services are available to verified employees of Colleges and Universities. We do not sell to individuals. All purchases, rosters, evaluations, and work remain within the school account. Once you leave a program, you will no longer have access to that schoolâ€™s PrepSearch account and will need to complete a new registration.</Text>
